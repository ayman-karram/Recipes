## Architecture
- MVVM (Separating the visual part of the app "the user interface, or UI" from the related code, Ease of maintainability, Bindings make UI updates easier to handle, Ease of testing)
- Coordinator Pattern (Moving view controller creation, configuration, and presentation away from view controller level and into coordinator level (limit responsibilities of view controllers), Isolate flows of the app so they may be more reusable, testable, and scalable.
